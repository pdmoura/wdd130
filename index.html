        <p><br>Hello! I'm Pedro Alves, a 22-year-old from Brasília, Brazil. I recently completed a mission and currently work as a call center agent. I'm really enjoying being a BYU student and I'm excited about the WDD130 intro to web development course! In my free time, I enjoy gaming, spending time with friends, skating, and exploring the world of coding. Interestingly, my journey with English began through immersing myself in video games, watching YouTube videos, and listening to music. These passions not only entertained me but also significantly improved my language skills. I'm very excited to expand my programming skills and embark on this exciting learning experience.<br>Let's code!</p>
